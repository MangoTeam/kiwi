- How do we recognize when cassowary has made a decision w.r.t. constraints? e.g. breaking a constraint
- draw a rectangle and print out its left, right, top, bottom, width, and height

- Display variables, expressions, and constraints on the page
- Create and remove boxes dynamically
- direct manipulation of the attributes of the boxes and parent


- add the "physics" constraints to cassowary
  all variables must be positive
  right - left = width <- required
  bottom - top = height <- required
